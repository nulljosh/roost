npm install && npm run dev

node src/data/listings.test.mjs
```

## Data

Listings are generated per place and seeded from its coordinates, so a city always
shows the same homes. The shape matches an MLS/IDX response. Swapping in a real
feed is one function in `src/data/listings.js`.

## API and agent tools

An agent can drive this app. [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) lists the HTTP surface, where there
is one, and the WebMCP tools registered on `document.modelContext`. Tools come in three kinds:
read-only, writes you can undo, and the few that ask a human first.

# Roost API

Roost has no HTTP API of its own. Listings are bundled with the client and
favourites live in `localStorage`; user accounts go straight to Supabase from
the browser (`src/lib/supabase.js`). The agent-facing interface is WebMCP.

## WebMCP

With the app open and signed in, roost registers tools on
`document.modelContext`. Source: `src/lib/webmcp.jsx`.

### Read-only

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `search_listings` | Search listings. Omitted filters fall back to what's set in the UI. Args: `priceMin`, `priceMax`, `beds`, `propertyType`, `favoritesOnly`, `sort`, `limit` |
| `get_listing` | Full record for one listing, plus whether it's favourited |
| `get_favorites` | Every favourited listing |
| `get_filters` | The filters currently applied in the UI |

### Reversible writes

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `toggle_favorite` | Add or remove a listing from favourites |
| `set_filters` | Apply filters to the UI so the user sees the same results |
| `reset_filters` | Clear filters back to defaults |
| `open_listing` | Navigate the app to a listing detail page |

Nothing here spends money or destroys data, so no tool requires confirmation.

Search shares `src/lib/filterListings.js` with the Listings page, so tool
results and the on-screen list can't drift apart.

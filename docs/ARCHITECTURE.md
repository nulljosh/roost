# Architecture

Roost is a worldwide real estate browser. Search homes for sale or rent in any city globally through a deterministic listing generator seeded by coordinates. Deployed as a web app (React + Vite on Cloudflare Pages), native iOS/Android and macOS via Kotlin Multiplatform, and a CLI (Swift TUI).

## How it runs

Web app: `index.html` loads `src/main.jsx` (React DOM bootstrap) which renders `src/App.jsx`. The router serves `Landing` publicly, auth pages (`Login`, `Register`, `ForgotPassword`) to all, and protected pages (`Listings`, `ListingDetail`, `Settings`) only to authenticated users. On mount, `AuthContext` checks Supabase for a session. User searches for a place through `Nav`'s `PlaceSearch`, which calls `searchPlaces` and returns results from Nominatim. Selecting a place updates `PlaceContext`, which calls `generateListings` with the place's coordinates as a seed, producing deterministic inventory. The `Listings` page filters and sorts them using `filterListings`. Clicking a listing routes to `ListingDetail`, which shows a gallery, map pin, and full metadata. Favorites and filter state persist in localStorage.

TUI (`tui/main.swift`): calls Nominatim directly (no custom backend) to search places and generate listings, outputting them as structured cards in the terminal.

KMP (`kmp/`): shared Kotlin business logic (`Geo.kt`, `Listings.kt`, `Market.kt`) runs on Android, iOS, and desktop. Platform-specific entry points delegate to `AppScreen.kt`.

## Localization

All 25 languages share the same build. `src/i18n/strings.js` holds English as the source; missing keys in any locale fall back to English, so partial translations ship safely. Right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian) get `dir="rtl"` on the root element. `Landing.jsx` shows a language picker; selection persists in localStorage.

## Listing generation

`generateListings` takes a place and coordinates, hashes them into a seed, and uses a seeded linear-congruential RNG to pick names, photos, prices, and counts deterministically. Two nearby cities produce different inventory; the same city always produces the same homes. Photos come from an Unsplash URL list. Prices are randomized within country-specific ranges (via `marketFor`). Property types (house/condo/townhouse) are picked randomly. Street names come from real Overpass data when available, otherwise invented.

## External services

- **Nominatim** (OpenStreetMap geocoding): worldwide place search, no API key. Respects 1 req/sec courtesy limit via debounced search box.
- **Overpass** (OSM street data): three mirrors (de, kumi.systems, osm.ch) queried in order; results cached 30 days in localStorage. Query caps bounding box to 0.25 degrees around place center to avoid multi-minute timeouts on large countries.
- **Supabase** (auth, optional user data): email/password sign-in, Apple/Google OAuth delegation.
- **Leaflet** (map rendering): open-source JS map library.

## Gotchas

- Address formatting (house number before or after street) varies by country. `formatAddress` checks a per-country set to get it right per locale.
- Map marker overlap at city zoom is real. `visibleForZoom` culls markers by a zoom-dependent cap, rejecting pills that would overlap at Web Mercator projection. Only pins that survive are rendered.
- Overpass queries can return stale data (servers are community-run and lag real edits). Ingesting them anyway: if streets fail to load, the generator invents addresses at the city centroid rather than stalling.
- Service worker caches the build for one load even after deploy. Verify new content with a hard reload or unregister the worker.
